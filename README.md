# Melanoma-skin-cancer-detection
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a ML model for prediction of telecom churn based on available independent variables.
- For this project, we are using the data ![download data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zg6b-M_FXkLehP3P9eeqkcrJV8H4Clzc/view?usp=drive_link).

## Conclusions
- We built a CNN model which predicts the class based on the image provided.
